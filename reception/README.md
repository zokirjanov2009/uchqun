## Data Storage

The admin panel uses `localStorage` for frontend-only data persistence. It shares the same storage keys as the main frontend application, allowing seamless data management across both applications.

## Role Hierarchy

- **Admin** → Full system access (this panel)
- **Teacher** → Manage parent-related data
- **Parent** → Read-only access
