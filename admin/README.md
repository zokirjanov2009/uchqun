## Data Storage

The super admin panel uses `localStorage` for frontend-only data persistence. It shares the same storage keys as other applications, allowing seamless data management across the system.

## Role Hierarchy

- **Super Admin** → Complete system access (this panel)
- **Admin** → Full system access (admin panel)
- **Teacher** → Manage parent-related data
- **Parent** → Read-only access
